Book Review Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks

A machine learning pipeline to classify the sentiment of book reviews using neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

This project focuses on predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of book reviews using a feedforward neural network trained on a dataset of review text. It applies a complete machine learning workflow including:
	- Text preprocessing and cleaning
(lowercasing, removing special characters, and vectorizing using TF-IDF)
	- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
(distribution of review sentiments, word frequency analysis)
	- Model design and training using TensorFlow/Keras
(feedforward neural network with varying dropout rates and training epochs)
	- Hyperparameter experimentation
(testing model performance under different regularization and training configurations)
	- Evaluation through accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices

The final model achieves consistent sentiment classification performance, highlighting how neural networks can be applied to simple NLP tasks. This approach can be expanded to other domains like product reviews, movie feedback, or customer satisfaction analysis.
