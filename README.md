# Book Review Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks

A machine learning pipeline for classifying the sentiment (positive or negative) of book reviews using a feedforward neural network and NLP techniques.

## Overview

This project applies a complete ML workflow on a dataset of book reviews:

- **Text preprocessing and cleaning**
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and TF-IDF vectorization
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
  - Label distribution and word frequency analysis
- **Model building with TensorFlow/Keras**
  - Feedforward neural network with tuned dropout rates and epoch counts
- **Evaluation**
  - Accuracy tracking, validation loss analysis, and confusion matrix generation

## Results

- Achieved consistent binary sentiment classification performance
- Dropout tuning and epoch control improved generalization
- Demonstrated neural networksâ€™ effectiveness in basic NLP classification tasks

This pipeline can be extended to sentiment analysis in product reviews, customer feedback, or social media posts.
